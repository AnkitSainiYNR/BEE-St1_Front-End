# BEE-St1_Front-End

The name of the app is TRAVEL BLOGS

It is made in React which gives us smooth functioning.
I use Axios to fetch the data of blogs from my own backend database.
React Routers give us such a thing that we can switch between pages without reloading unnecessary things.

This is basically depends on CRUD Operations: 
C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete

In this, we can write blog, delete blog, update and get also.
Another functionalities are to create user, update and delete user whithout any error.
